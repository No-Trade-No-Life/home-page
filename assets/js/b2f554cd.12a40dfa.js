This is the original meaning of No Trade No Life.\\n\\nIn order to avoid over-expanding the topic and causing controversy, we first exclude several topics:\\n\\n1. We do not consider how to solve the problem of the gap between rich and poor. This is a political issue and a subject that government social managers need to consider;\\n2. We do not consider how to directly promote economic development. This is a scientific issue and a topic that talents from all walks of life need to consider;\\n\\nWe look at each investor\'s perspective, think about how to manage their wealth in a scientific and efficient manner, and help investors overcome the difficulties encountered in the investment process.\\n\\nWe want to clarify the difficulty of investing and provide targeted solutions so that technology can enhance users\' personal abilities and help users perform better investment operations.\\n\\nSo, what exactly is the difficulty with investing?\\n\\n1. The market is non-stop and investment is too busy (the contradiction between excessive information and inefficient processing capabilities);\\n2. Diverse needs and too few options (the contradiction between diversified investment needs and a small supply of investment products);\\n3. The ideas are beautiful but the knowledge is too little (the contradiction between investors\u2019 expectations and investors\u2019 abilities does not match);\\n4. Taking things for granted and lack of awareness (Contradiction between investor\u2019s sensibility and investor\u2019s rationality)\\n\\nTo this end, we have proposed targeted solutions to the above problems:\\n\\n1. Utilize a series of technologies including AI, cloud computing, etc. to realize automatic transactions, free up users\u2019 time and energy, and liberate productivity.\\n2. Users can choose from market standard investment products, combine them with compound investment products, build investment portfolios, and establish private equity funds, thereby greatly enriching investment products to meet the investment needs of themselves and their surrounding friends.\\n3. Find lessons from history and experience from knowledge. Enrich the testing system and build an investment and trading knowledge base to help novices become professional investors step by step and help all investors manage their expectations.\\n4. Through data visualization, boring data is transformed into a format that can directly stimulate users\' perceptual thinking through vision, helping users get rid of the inertia of taken-for-granted thinking.\\n\\nIf one day the vision of economic development is realized and people\'s living standards improve, it may be because:\\n\\n1. If investing is still important, then everyone has a good investment operating system. (I hope that will be our Yuan)\\n2. If investment no longer matters, then communism has probably been achieved."},{"id":"do-we-really-need-python-for-quant","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/do-we-really-need-python-for-quant","editUrl":"https://github.com/No-Trade-No-Life/Yuan/tree/main/ui/docs/blog/2023-11-17-do-we-really-need-python-for-quant.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-11-17-do-we-really-need-python-for-quant.md","title":"Do we really need Python for Quant?","description":"Nowadays, Python is the most popular programming language in quantitative trading.

While it has many advantages, such as being easy to learn and having a great ecosystem for data science, quantitative investment platforms like Quantopian, JoinQuant, and QuantConnect have struggled to be profitable, despite the decreasing costs of internet infrastructure. This is because the software depends on computing power, which remains expensive.\\n\\nLocal installed software can be cheaper, but it can be difficult for non-professional traders to install and use. Platforms often provide a web GUI for users to overcome this issue. Some argue that local installed software is not cross-platform, cannot utilize cloud computing power, and are not highly available.\\n\\nThe reason why users don\'t want to pay for cloud computing power is that they do not see the value in it. Quantitative trading requires a lot of research and development, which can be costly in terms of computing power and time. If users are not convinced that they can make money from the platform, they will not pay for it.\\n\\nTherefore, we propose a solution: replace Python with JavaScript. JavaScript can be used in the browser, allowing users to utilize their own computing power and eliminating the need for a local installation. The JavaScript ecosystem is mature and growing, making it the best ecosystem for web development and data science. And JavaScript is faster than Python.\\n\\nWe have built a quantitative platform with JavaScript that can run in a browser and on cloud servers. The research and development can be done completely free in the browser until users want to run the model in cloud servers. This way, users can gain value from the platform before paying for it, and the platform can pay for the computing power after receiving payment, making it a win-win solution.\\n\\nIn the future, we will share how we store and distribute data without cost, ensuring that the platform will always be running. With these advantages, we are confident that JavaScript is the best choice for the future of quantitative trading."}]}')}}]);
