However, investors and capital cannot easily cross the barriers between unified markets, which are usually political, and sometimes technical. These barriers, in general, create a state of stasis. This mobility and stasis form a contradiction. If there is a good standard, it will enhance the mobility of investors, weaken the technical barriers between markets, but have no impact on the political barriers between markets.

When we integrated with CCXT, we found that it could not completely isolate the knowledge of specific exchanges.
